Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent? 
My class represents the player character in a text-based adventure video game where the player is able to interact with items and, by the time that 
this game is finished for the final project, be able to navigate through rooms through walking and different parts of a map by flying. The player can 
change their size and rest at specific sections of the game so that they may fit into small spaces, reach tall places, and restore the health points 
that they lose from encountering enemies or obstacles which hurt the player-- which will be implemented in a later version. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
